# Castellari AutoCar

Castellari is an autocar service, localized in Barra Bonita, SP, Brazil. This app is just to make the life of operators here more easy, making bill order.

## How this work?

Well, this is built with Kotlin and [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose), internally work very like all recent native android apps. The user insert a client name, telephone, vehicle description, and license plate, after that, insert all things the operator makes in the car, like maintenance, change, and fix car things.

Finally, the user request to generate a PDF with all bill orders, the total price of process will calculate and added to final bill. The user can save or share this PDF.

## How use that

Sorry but today this app still in development, so I can't let one APK here. If you want to test it, you need to build in your computer, after that, use an emulator or smartphone to see the UI.

The step by step about how to make this shit work.
First, you need to install [android studio LTS](https://developer.android.com/studio), after that, [clone this repository](https://github.com/UR4N0-235/Castellari/archive/refs/heads/master.zip), unzip that, and finally click to open with an android studio project. Install an [android emulator](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator) in android studio, or just [connect your smartphone](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device) to mode Debug USB or Wi-Fi debugger on, after that, the android studio will recognize and can make a built app for you.

In some futer I will make an more friendly tutorial, but today this is all I can do, sorry for that :/
